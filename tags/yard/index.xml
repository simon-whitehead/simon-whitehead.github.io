      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a sucker for low level programming. I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert at it &amp;hellip; but I understand enough to be pretty dangerous. All low level programming is interesting.. but I&amp;rsquo;ve found 64-bit Windows programming to be one of the most interesting. It is also one of the most confusing for many people.
This is the start of a series on 64-bit Windows assembly for beginners. This is a topic many find hard to get into due to the lack of/hard to find information and some simple explanations.</description>
